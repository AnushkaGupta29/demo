<h1><center>My Favorite Poem</center></h1>
<p>
    The sun sets in the west,<br>
    Leaving colors in the sky.<br>
    The day says its final farewell,<br>
    As the stars begin to fly.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    The moon rises high above,<br>
    Bathing the world in light.<br>
    The night whispers softly,<br>
    Bringing dreams into the night.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    The silence of the night,<br>
    So calm and serene.<br>
    A moment of reflection,<br>
    In a world of ever-changing scenes.
